Then, you must regularly remove weeds so they don't take water and nutrients from your maize. Finally, keep an eye out for pests (like stalk borers) and diseases and take action if you see them."
How do I calibrate my sprayer for herbicide application?,farm_management,"Calibration involves determining your walking speed, spray width, and nozzle output to calculate how much water (and thus herbicide) you apply per unit area, ensuring you apply the correct dose."
Can the seeds I use carry diseases that will affect my maize crop?,disease_transmission,"Yes, some diseases can be present on or inside the maize seed itself. Using infected seeds can introduce diseases to your field right from the start. It's important to use healthy, certified seeds if possible."
Can you give me an example of a maize disease?,disease_transmission,"A common example of a maize disease in Malawi is Gray Leaf Spot (GLS). You'll recognize it by the long, rectangular, grayish-brown spots that appear on the leaves of the maize plants. These spots often start on the lower leaves and can spread upwards, causing the leaves to dry out and potentially reducing your maize harvest."
